This analysis delves into a dataset provided by a Portuguese banking institution, focusing on their direct marketing campaigns conducted through phone calls. The objective is to build a classification model that predicts a client's likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. The data encompasses various client attributes like demographics (age, marital status, education), financial situation (balance, loan status), and details of the current marketing campaign (contact type, duration). Additionally, it incorporates information from previous campaigns (number of contacts, outcomes). By leveraging this rich data, we aim to empower the bank to optimize future marketing efforts and target the most receptive customers for term deposit subscriptions.
